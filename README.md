# A Simple console app that helps you identify open slots for Padron in madrid.
In the appsettings.json, change the office Id and name (You can get it from here - https://gestionturnos.madrid.es/GNSIS_WBCIUDADANO/tramite.do but you will have to inspect through F12 to get the Office Id).

If you want to try getting the slot manually, try early in the morning at around 6-7. Usually they open the slot that time.

The application now supports two mode:
1. Padron appointment
2. Clave appointment (Clave Pin or Certificate)
